            <ol>
                <li>Mix salt, garlic powder, cumin, oregano, coriander, and cinnamon together in a bowl; coat pork with spice mixture. Place bay leaves in the bottom of a slow cooker and arrange pork on top. Pour chicken broth around the sides of pork, being careful not to rinse off spice mixture.</li>

                <li>When the pork is tender, remove from the slow cooker; shred with two forks. Use cooking liquid as needed to moisten the meat.</li>
