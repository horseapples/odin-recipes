        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken, broccoli, and rice noodles are cooked in a sweet soy sauce in this quick and easy Thai noodle dish that's ready in just 20 minutes.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <uo>
                <li>1 (6 ounce) package rice stick noodles (rice vermicelli)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons dark soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>    
                <li>2 teaspoons distilled white vinegar</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic</li>    
                <li>5 ounces Chicken, broilers or fryers, thigh, meat only, raw</li>
                <li>1 cup small broccoli florets</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
            </uo>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place rice noodles in a large bowl and cover with boiling water. Soak until tender, 4 to 8 minutes. Rinse thoroughly with water and leave in a colander to drain.</li>
                <li>Combine oyster sauce, water, dark and regular soy sauce, vinegar, and sugar in a small bowl.</li>
                <li>Place a wok over high heat; add oil and mince garlic straight into the wok. Heat until oil is hot and garlic is starting to turn golden, about 1 minute. Add chicken and broccoli; stir-fry for 1 minute. Move chicken and broccoli to one side. Crack egg into the skillet and scramble it, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Add noodles and sauce; fold gently to combine, until sauce evenly coats the noodles and caramelizes a bit, and chicken is cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes.</li> 
            </ol>
